# Dev Environment Setup

I've now gone through the process of configuring a Linux machine with everything required to do development on this project.  In fact, I've gone through it several times recently as I flashed Linux to some of my own machines for the purpose of developmessnt.  I'm going to leave this doc populated with some copy/pasted Bash (and otherwise) scripts that will do most of that work.

```bash

# Install IntelliJ, 

# Install Discord
 
# Install Docker Desktop

# Install Git

# Install Node

# Install Yarn

# Configure NPM credentials

# Configure Docker credentials

# (Maybe) Install Bun


```
