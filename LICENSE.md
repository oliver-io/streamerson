LOVE ALL MY CATS PUBLIC LICENSE:

> TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

1. Do whatever you like with the original work; you just have to love all my cats (LAMC), Curie and Anastasia (henceforth referred to as "MY CATS", which refers to both feline legal entities simultaneously in every case).

   Loving all my cats (LAMC) and thus complying with this license includes - but is not limited to - the following:

    - 1a. You must harbor positive internal emotions toward MY CATS

    - 1b. You must, when publicly portraying, depicting, or referencing MY CATS, imbue their representations with positive charm, intellect, and skill

    - 1c. You must credit MY CATS somewhere in a reference in any text file, external documentation, or public attributions

    - 1c.1. You must not remove the above (LAMC section 1, subsection *1c.1*) in any future reproductions, copies, or publications of your source code

    - 1d. You must (upon request by ME [Oliverio Leo Carrillo]) provide written or verbal evidence of love for MY CATS

   *By using, copying, distributing, or modifying this code, you agree to all of the above (Section 1, Subsections **1a** ... **1d**) conditions.*


2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,
   share the love. Only a greedy fool would use this code and not love MY CATS (the only tangible requirement of this document)

3. Code is provided with no warranty. MY CATS and myself (Oliverio Leo Carrillo) do not agree to maintain, support, or guarantee the security, performance, readability, testability, portability, extensibility, modularity, or actual function/purpose of this code.

4. You may copy and distribute verbatim or modified
   copies of this license document with the following restrictions:

    - 4a. You must preserve the requirement to Love All My (Oliverio Leo Carrillo) Cats (Curie and Anastasia)
    - 4b. You may extend this license to require the Love of Other Cats with no restriction
    - 5b. You may NOT extend this license to require the Love of Animals other than Cats (here understood to mean any animal, living or dead, that at the time of its life was a member of the suborder *Feliformia* and family *Felidae*)
